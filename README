<<<<<<< HEAD
First github repository (test!)
=======
First github repository (test!) -edited to be the TestBranch version
If I add all this stuff, there should be a merge problem.
Also, github won't look at the TestBranch branch..

So it seems like you have to git commit... and then do this to get github to see the new branch: 'git push origin [branch_name]'

>>>>>>> TestBranch
End of test.
